In modern society, millions of people turn on his\her computers, smartphones, and other devices to send, store, and exchange any kind of information. Their lives are greatly impacted by technology‚Äôs effectiveness and speed. However, few of them became aware of the malicious activities they can encounter as soon as they press the send button. Development of technology offers both new opportunities and dangers. Technology will always have disadvantages along with its benefits, one should be conscious of this. The quick advancement of technology has created an increase in risks and cyber threats. These days, it is tough to find a business or even a part of daily life that is not in some way touched by digital data storage. Consequently, we really need to secure data.

Since I have been studying Cybersecurity, I have had the great chance to experience many of the hazards that come with data exposure. My work experience has inspired me to expand my understanding of cybersecurity so that I could steadily advance my professional capabilities and turn into a cybersecurity specialist. I am certain that Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate is the foundation for  me in achieving this objective.

When it comes to my character qualities, I would describe myself to be hard working and persistent. Over the years, while working for an IT company, I made sure to stay current with new technological advancements. I‚Äôve always enjoyed spending my leisure time reading scholarly articles and watching technology-related documentaries. I make an effort to strike a balance between my academic and social pursuits. If I didn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd be absolutely out of energy. My drawing and design abilities are something I work on. I have participated in and received awards in numerous drawing competitions. My ability to focus is improved by drawing, and the IT industry requires a high level of concentration. I‚Äôm described as eager and vivacious by my co-workers and friends.

My prior work experience and how the world has shifted have motivated me to pursue higher education. My experience working for an IT firm has broadened my perspective and made me more aware of how critical cyber threats are. Since I want to make a difference, I would prefer to work in cyber security than as an IT specialist. Most users of these digital and internet platforms have no idea how serious the cyber threat is. It has had an impact on numerous businesses in several nations. Nowadays, basic security software is inadequate. Because of this, I want to develop more practical and effective solutions to the security problems that concern people both personally and nationally.

The distinctive methodology used at Google, which incorporates case study assessment, cyber security groups, and tech meetups, will greatly mould the professional in me. After finishing the course, I‚Äôll be able to better understand a variety of subjects, including digital forensics, risk assessment, hacking exploits, and algorithmic ideas. Upon finishing the course, I will be skilled in security protection and response and acquire the various technologies and skills necessary to establish a lucrative career in the field of cyber security.

I intend to build my own business, which would provide cybersecurity services to African American start-ups and small businesses. I must join this course if I want to develop a thorough understanding of the sector and a technological advantage over cybercriminals. We may benefit from advanced technologies, but this should not be done at the expense of people‚Äôs natural freedom. My career will be greatly boosted by specialising in cyber security. It would be a fabulous opportunity to combine my enthusiasm and professional aspirations together in order to establish myself a tricky yet intriguing career.
